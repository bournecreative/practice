Output: [1,2]

Brute force method. This is considered brute force because we have a loop inside of another loop, which means we will have to 
run through the array once for every single number within the array (Quadratic runtime). 
This algorithm has a big o notation of nÂ². As the array grows, so too does the time to complete.
